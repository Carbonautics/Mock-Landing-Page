# Diving into Frontend Designs

In an attempt to learn frontend web-development and also make my current portfolio landing page better, I found this very useful video about this subject and this is all the code that I wrote following along with this course.
Currently my first go at this, so the code might look exactly like her. I hope to practice a lot and write it eventually on my own.
